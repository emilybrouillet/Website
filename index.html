<p>
I'm a rising junior currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science + Math at Washington University in Saint Louis. When I was much younger, as social media and technology began to become prevalent in our daily lives, new technology started to peak my curiosity. So far I have a taking a strong emphasis in application programming classes, trying to give my skill set as wide a breadth as possible before beginning to specialize. My goal is to eventually work in the cybersecurity field, where I hope to be able to make these applications a safer place for both individual users and all participants as a whole.
</p>

<p>
I am on track to graduate in the spring of 2025 with a Bachelor of Science. I am currently looking for an internship during the summer of 2024 and a full-time job following my graduation.
</p>

<p>
Outside of my academics I spend a lot of my time with my two dogs, who I often take to many of the parks in and around the Saint Louis area. I have two younger brothers, who I love going to Cardinals games with when we have the opportunity. Iâ€™m also a big reader, I generally choose books in the non-fiction and sci-fi genres. I've recently started to enjoy both cooking and baking for myself and my family(not the cleaning.)
